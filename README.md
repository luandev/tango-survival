# 💃 Tango-Survival 💃

Welcome to **Tango-Survival**, the game that will twist your logic and keep you on your toes. Imagine Sudoku but with shapes, a lot more flair, and a little less math. 🌀✨

## What is Tango-Survival?
Tango-Survival is a React-based grid game based on [linkedin game tango](https://www.linkedin.com/games/tango/) where the challenge is to fill a NxN grid with circles, squares, and empty cells. But wait, there’s a twist! You must do this without ever having more than **two consecutive shapes** in a row or column. Oh, and every row and column must be perfectly balanced between the shapes. It's all about the dance of logic, baby! 💃🕺

### Rules
1. **No more than 2 consecutive shapes** in a row or column. It’s called “Tango” because you need to keep the balance – no over-clustering!
2. **Equal number of shapes** in each row and column. It’s all about that balance. Think of it like keeping your dance partner on their toes!
3. **Complete the grid** and achieve perfect balance to win the game. ⚖️

### How to Play
- 🖱️ **Click on a Cell**: Toggle between circle, square, or empty. Find that perfect configuration!
- ⚠️ **Watch for Warnings**: Rows or columns turning a sad, invalid red? Time to re-evaluate your choices!
- 🏆 **Win by Filling the Grid Correctly**: Achieve balance and harmony across the grid to master the tango!
